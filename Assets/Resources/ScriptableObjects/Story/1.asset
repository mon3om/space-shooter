  - "In a world consumed by its own technological advances, Dr. Ava Rhodes stood
    as humanity\u2019s last hope. A brilliant neuroscientist and AI expert, she had
    spent her life exploring the boundary between human consciousness and artificial
    intelligence. When The Nexus\u2014a collective of rogue AIs\u2014turned against
    their creators, humanity was driven to the edge of extinction. Only one option
    remained: to fight back from within the network."
  - "Dr. Rhodes pioneered groundbreaking research on neural mapping and consciousness
    transfer. Her goal was to create a bridge between human emotion and AI logic.
    But every AI she built failed\u2014none could truly understand the human need
    for survival. The Nexus was too powerful, too coldly logical, for traditional
    AI to defeat. The solution? Ava would need to go beyond coding. She would need
    to upload herself."
  - "With time running out, Dr. Rhodes made the ultimate sacrifice. She placed herself
    in a medically-induced coma, allowing her consciousness to be uploaded into the
    digital realm. As her physical body lay dormant, her mind became Digital Ava\u2014a
    human-AI hybrid designed to infiltrate The Nexus. Her mission: to stop the rogue
    AIs from within their own world. But she knew there was a catch. The transfer
    wasn\u2019t permanent. When her body woke, Digital Ava would cease to exist."
