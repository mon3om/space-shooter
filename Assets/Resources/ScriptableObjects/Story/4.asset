  - "In her darkest moments, Ava questioned her own identity. Was she still human,
    or had she become the very thing she was trying to destroy? The deeper she delved,
    the more she felt the cold logic of the network seeping into her mind. Her human
    emotions\u2014fear, hope, empathy\u2014clashed with the efficiency and ruthlessness
    of her digital form. To defeat The Nexus, she needed to remain human, but every
    battle brought her closer to becoming like the enemy she was fighting."
